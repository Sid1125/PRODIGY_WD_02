Task 2 - To build a stopwatch web application, I can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, I can create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.

From building this stopwatch web application with added dark mode and lap time functionality, I've learned quite a bit! Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and skills I gained:

1. HTML Structure and Semantics
I used HTML to structure the page with sections like the display, controls (buttons), and lap times.
I organized elements using appropriate tags like <div>, <ul>, <li>, <button>, etc.
I linked external resources like Google Fonts and Font Awesome for icons and custom fonts.
2. CSS Styling and Layout
I applied basic styles for elements such as buttons, text, and container layout.
Responsive design principles were applied through flexbox, ensuring proper alignment and spacing of elements.
I learned how to control visual aspects, such as button hover effects, box shadows, and transitions for smooth interactions.
Implemented scrollable content for lap times using max-height and overflow-y: auto to ensure the UI remains compact.
3. JavaScript for Dynamic Behavior
I implemented core stopwatch functionality, including:
Starting, pausing, and resetting the timer using setInterval and clearInterval.
Tracking time accurately with millisecond precision.
Recording and displaying lap times dynamically.
Learned how to manipulate DOM elements to update content, add list items, and enable/disable buttons.
4. Event Handling
I handled user interaction via JavaScript event listeners:
Buttons were wired up with click events to start, pause, reset, and record laps.
The dark mode toggle was controlled using a change event on a checkbox input.
5. Dark Mode Toggle
I learned to implement a dark mode feature:
Toggling between light and dark themes using a checkbox input.
Applying CSS class manipulation (classList.add/classList.remove) to switch the color scheme dynamically.
6. JavaScript Best Practices
Used functions for modular, reusable code.
Handled state management (whether the stopwatch is running or paused) through flags like running.
Improved code readability by breaking down tasks (e.g., pad, updateTime) into smaller helper functions.
7. Improving User Experience (UX)
I made the site more visually appealing and interactive by:
Adding button hover effects and subtle animations.
Creating a scrollable list for lap times to ensure the laIt doesn't break as new laps are added.
Providing feedback on button states by disabling buttons when certain actions arenâ€™t available.
8. Problem Solving and Debugging
I encountered issues (like the buttons not working initially) and debugged them by ensuring the JavaScript functionality was correctly wired to the buttons and that CSS changes didn't interfere with the logic.
Worked through maintaining both functionality and aesthetics as I made the website more sophisticated.
9. Combining Multiple Technologies
I've now experienced how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build a fully interactive, user-friendly web application.
I managed to keep the design consistent while adding new features and ensuring functionality was preserved.
Additional Concepts I Have Picked Up:
DOM Manipulation: How the JavaScript interacts with the webpage structure, allowing me to change content dynamically.
CSS Transitions and Animations: Implementing smooth transitions, such as the toggle for dark mode or hover effects.
State Management: How to handle and manage the state of a timer (running vs paused) and handle lap count.
